# i3wm
I use Fedora Linux on both machines.

This repo containes files pertaining to my customized configuration of the i3wm (i3 window manager).

Please note, I have as the i3 config two different config files for two different laptops. Pick whichever one more suits your purpose, your actual need, or take out of each that which is applicable for your individual requirement. 

# Customization
If you do not want to use the particular apps contained in my i3 config in favour of alternative apps, then you'llonly need to edit your ~/.i3/config accordingly. The same applies to any other change you may want to make to your i3 config file.
