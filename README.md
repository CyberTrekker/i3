# i3wm
I use Fedora Linux on both machines.

Files for my custom configuration of the i3wm (i3 window manager).

Please note, I have as the i3 config two different config files for two different laptops. Pick whichever one more suits your purpose, your actual need, or take out of each that which is applicable for your individual requirement.
